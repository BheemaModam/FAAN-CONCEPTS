Hint

You are given an integer n and an undirected tree rooted at node 0 with n nodes 
numbered from 0 to n - 1. This is represented by a 2D array edges of length n - 1, 
where edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates an undirected edge between nodes ui and vi.

You are also given an integer array nums, where nums[i] is the positive integer assigned to node i.
Define a value ti as the number of ancestors of node i such that the 
product nums[i] * nums[ancestor] is a.

Return the sum of all ti values for all nodes i in range [1, n - 1].

Note:

    In a rooted tree, the ancestors of node i are all nodes on the pa
