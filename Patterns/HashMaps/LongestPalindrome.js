Given a string s which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return the length of the longest  that can be built with those letters.

Letters are case sensitive, for example, "Aa" is not considered a palindrome.



Example 1:
Input: s = "abccccdd"
Output: 7
Explanation: One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.

Example 2:
Input: s = "a"
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest palindrome that can be built is "a", whose length is 1.



Constraints:
    1 <= s.length <= 2000
    s consists of lowercase and/or uppercase English letters only.
